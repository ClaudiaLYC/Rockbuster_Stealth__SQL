**CareerFoundry Data Analysis Portfolio Project**: a fictional movie rental company aims to maintain its competitiveness by utilizing its current movie licenses to introduce an online video rental service. 
Data analysis, with a primary focus on SQL queries, has been utilized in this project to streamline the process.

# Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictitious movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. The management team is planning to use its existing licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. Hired as a data analyst, my goal is to help the business intelligence department with the launch strategy for the new online video service.

# Project Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Below are the main questions expected to be answered:
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

# Tools Used
*Language*: PostgreSQL  
*Software*: pgAdmin, Tableau, Excel, DBVisualiser, PowerPoint

# Skills demonstrated with this project
**Cleaning data**: Checked and addressed duplicates, non-uniform data, and missing values.

**Joining tables**: Selected the type of joins and sequence of joins in order to minimize the time/memory needed.

**Writing queries**: Explored basic descriptive statistics (max/min, mean or mode) for variables and used GROUP BY and ORDER BY to answer more complex questions for the project results.

**Coding with Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Designed CTEs to enhance code in a more readable and easier way.

**Reporting results**: Reports were tailored to match the specific needs of the audience. Executives were provided with a PowerPoint presentation containing all the answers to their business questions as well as recommendations. Additionally, a data dictionary and an Excel workbook were generated to provide general access to all queries and findings.
